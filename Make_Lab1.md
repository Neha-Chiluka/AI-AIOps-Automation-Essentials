## Overview
This workflow collects lead data submitted via a Google Form, logs the information into a Google Sheet, sends a personalized confirmation email to the lead using the Email by Make module, and posts a notification to a Slack channel to alert your team about the new lead.

### Step 4: Configure Email by Make Module (Send "Reaching Out" Email)
1. **Add the Email Module:**  
   Click **+** after the Google Sheets module.

2. **Search and Select Email Module:**  
   Search for the **Email** module provided by Make (commonly labeled **"Send an Email"** under Email by Make).  
   This built-in module avoids the configuration complications sometimes encountered with external email services.

3. **Configure the Email:**
   - **To:**  
     Use the variable selector to choose the **Email** field from the Google Sheets data.
   - **Subject:**  
     Enter:  
     `Thank you for contacting us!`
   - **Body:**  
     Enter your message (plain text or HTML). For example:
     ```
     Hi {{Name}},
     
     Thank you for reaching out! Our team will get back to you soon.
     
     Regards,
     [Your Business Name]
     ```
4. **Save the Configuration.**

### Step 5: Add Slack Module for Team Notification
1. **Add the Slack Module:**  
   Click **+** after the Email module.

2. **Search and Select Slack Module:**  
   Search for **Slack** and select **"Send a Message."**

3. **Configure Slack Settings:**

   - **Connection\***:  
     Click the **Connection\*** field, then select or add your Slack connection by following the prompts to authorize access to your Slack workspace.

   - **Enter a channel ID or name\***:  
     Enter the channel name (e.g., `#leads-notification`) or the channel ID where you want the message to be posted.

   - **Channel type\***:  
     Select **Public channel** if you're using a public channel. (For private channels, additional settings may be required.)

   - **Map Text:**  
     Enter the primary message content as plain text (acts as a fallback if using Blocks). For example:
     ```
     ðŸš€ New Lead Alert!
     Name: {{Name}}
     Email: {{Email}}
     Company: {{Company Name}}
     ```
     
   - **Blocks (Optional):**  
     If you want to use Slackâ€™s Block Kit for a rich formatted message, configure Blocks here. Otherwise, leave this section empty.

4. **Save the Slack Module Configuration.**
